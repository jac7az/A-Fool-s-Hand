Point-based card game
# Rules 
1.   Each player starts with 5 cards in their hand
2.   There are three groups in the middle, each with 2 cards.
3. 1 game is made up of 4 rounds, with one pair of cards in the middle uncovered in each of the first three rounds. After each round, draw 2 cards.
4.    A combo is formed using the cards in the middle and your own cards. Each combo has a set number of points, listed below. Each player can place up to 4 cards in their zone for each group to complete a combo. Once the cards are placed and the round ends, the cards cannot be moved at all, not to another group or back to the hand.
