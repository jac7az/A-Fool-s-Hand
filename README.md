# A Fool's Hand
2-player card game modified into a point-based single-player game
# Rules 
1.   Each player starts with 5 cards in their hand
2.   There are three groups in the middle, each with 2 cards.
3. 1 game is made up of 4 rounds, with one pair of cards in the middle uncovered in each of the first three rounds. After each round, draw 2 cards.
4.    A combo is formed using the cards in the middle and your own cards. Each combo has a set number of points, listed below. Each player can place up to 4 cards in their zone for each group to complete a combo. Once the cards are placed and the round ends, the cards cannot be moved at all, not to another group or back to the hand.
5. During each round, players can discard up to 3 cards in their hand in exchange for new ones.
